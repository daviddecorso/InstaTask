# InstaTask

The idea for this product is a web app that imports a user's webcourses calendar and alerts them when assignments are due, since no one likes keeping track of, and inevitably forgetting, assignment due dates. The app will also display the assignments from webcourses in an intuitive way via a linked calendar and upcoming task view. We want to help students be more productive and have more control over their tasks and assignments.

Other task manager or calendar apps require you to manually input your tasks and specify if or when you want to be alerted for every task. At universities that use online learning platforms, professors and TAs have already done the hard work of manually inputting each and every assignment and exam online. Why should students have to do the same when the information is already available? That's why we want to automate this process, so getting alerts and viewing assignments is as easy as pressing a button.

Canvas nicely provides each user with a live link to their calendar .ical, so our app can automatically refresh a user’s feed once an initial URL has been provided. User calendars are saved to their account, allowing access across multiple devices and platforms.
